            The engine sputters, the power surges - the car comes to a stop. Ivy passed the last gas station 30 miles
            back but thought she could make it through this midwest deadzone. Ivy has no cell service, no fuel, and 12
            more miles until her final destination.
            <br><br>It is Halloween night and Ivy promised her brother that she would be home for (big ceremony).
            Knowing she had no other choice, Ivy got out of her car and started to walk. She walked between the gravel
            roads and the unkept cornfield.
            <br><br>Maybe it was because it was Halloween night or maybe it was because Ivy was alone and vulnerable,
            but Ivy began to feel chills down her spine. She felt as if she was being watched.

        <div class="Para2">“Shhhhh”
            Ivy freezes. Did someone say something to her? It must have been a gust of wind.
            <br><br>“Sssssssssssssssstop”
            <br><br>The echoes grow louder as Ivy continues.
            <br><br>Ivy stops. The wind stopped as well. Uneasy, Ivy begins to walk faster. Now she begins to run.
            <br><br>“Shhhhh”
            <br><br>The wind talks to Ivy again. Perhaps it is best if Ivy just waits in place until. She must not break
            the silence.

        <img class="Sidebar3L" src="images\fog.svg" alt="Fog">
        <div class="Para3">Ivy stops and looks at her watch and notices that it reads 8:00pm. Despite the mysterious
            wind, she must continue walking or else she won’t make it to (name). Only 2 more miles to go.
            Apprehensively, she decides to run once more.
            <br><br>The wind roars and rips through the corn, ghostly echoes grow around Ivy as she runs towards the
            dimly lit city ahead.
            <br><br>Beads of sweat drip down Ivy’s face as she runs on. Suddenly, she is grabbed and is pulled towards
            the cornfields - she looks back and sees a foggy figure towering over the road. This is what has been
            talking to her, this is what she has been running from.

        <div class="Para4">Ivy covers her mouth to quiet herself down and the ghostly grasp lets go of her but does not
            fade away. She notices the city is only a sprint away.
            <br><br>The foggy figure roars and follows Ivy close behind. The figure extends its phantom-like arms but
            not before Ivy grabbed a jack-o-lantern near the entrance to the city. Ivy throws the fiery pumpkin at the
            figure and it lets out a scorching scream. The fog burns away and the wind comes to a stop.
            <br><br>At last, terror-stricken and perspiring, she had arrived… just in time for her brother.
